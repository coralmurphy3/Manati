# Project 2
 
### This is my submission for the LEDE Program’s second project, which includes a map of Manatí, Puerto Rico, with points representing a street and a sidebar that details the biography of the person the street is named after. 

### I wanted to conduct an oral history project related to the rural town on the island and focus specifically on the streets named after people that might not be so well known.  

### I established the points in Google My Maps, transferred the KML file to GeoJSON, and then inserted the file in Datawrapper to make the map.  

# Data Collection Process

### I used Google Maps to identify the streets in Manatí's "downtown" area. I then used the book "Figuras de la Atenas de Puerto Rico" by Manuel Figueroa Melendez, which collects the biographies of prominent people who lived in Manatí. The book only had some of the people in the streets I was looking at, so some of the figures remain without a biography. 

### To collect the rest of the biographies, my plan is to interview people in Manatí to create an archive of stories and place them in the map. 

# Skills learned

### I learned how to use Bootstrap to design my webpage, including the accordion-style navigation sidebar. 

### Also, although no JavaScript is present in this version, I'm learning to implement it and look forward to future classes to use JavaScript for later versions of this project. 

# Things I would’ve liked to do

### I wanted to make the map more interactive by allowing the user to hover over a point in the map while simultaneously highlighting the sidebar tab (person) that accompanies the street. 

### For a future version of this project, I want to use Illustrator to add icons to my map, such as local landmarks.
